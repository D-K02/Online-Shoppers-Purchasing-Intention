## Online Shoppers Intention Prediction

### Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether online shoppers will generate revenue based on their browsing behavior on an e-commerce website. The model utilizes a dataset containing various features related to user interactions, such as page views, time spent on pages, and other behavioral metrics.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is called `online_shoppers_intention.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- **Administrative**: Number of administrative pages viewed.
- **Administrative_Duration**: Total time spent on administrative pages.
- **Informational**: Number of informational pages viewed.
- **Informational_Duration**: Total time spent on informational pages.
- **ProductRelated**: Number of product-related pages viewed.
- **ProductRelated_Duration**: Total time spent on product-related pages.
- **BounceRates**: Percentage of single-page visits.
- **ExitRates**: Percentage of exits from the site.
- **PageValues**: Average value of a page based on the revenue generated.
- **SpecialDay**: Indicates if the visit occurred on a special day (e.g., holiday).
- **Month**: Month of the visit.
- **OperatingSystems**: The operating system used by the visitor.
- **Browser**: The browser used by the visitor.
- **Region**: The region where the visitor is located.
- **TrafficType**: Type of traffic (e.g., direct, referral).
- **VisitorType**: Whether the visitor is a new or returning visitor.
- **Weekend**: Indicates if the visit occurred on a weekend.
- **Revenue**: Indicates whether the visitor made a purchase (target variable).

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd online_shoppers_intention_prediction
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run `data_preprocessing.py` to clean and preprocess the dataset.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Execute `feature_selection.py` to select relevant features for modeling.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Use `model_training.ipynb` to train various models and perform hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in `model_evaluation.py`.

5. **Predicting Unseen Data**:
   - Load the saved model (`best_model.joblib`) and use it to make predictions on new unseen data.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model for online shopper behavior using machine learning techniques. The insights gained from this analysis can help e-commerce businesses enhance their marketing strategies and improve user engagement.

### Limitations

1. **Imbalanced Classes**: The dataset may contain imbalanced classes, which could affect model performance.
2. **Temporal Bias**: Consumer behavior may change over time, affecting the model's applicability to future data.
3. **Feature Availability**: The model's performance depends on having all relevant features available in unseen data.
